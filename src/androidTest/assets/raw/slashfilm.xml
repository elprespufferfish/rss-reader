      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/starwars7-bb8-desert.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-312175 aligncenter" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/starwars7-bb8-desert-700x338.jpg?resize=700%2C338" alt="BB-8 Sounds" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Even though <strong><em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em></strong> isn&#8217;t out until December 18th, some fans have already decided that their new favorite character is the adorable little ball droid known as <strong>BB-8</strong>. The character debuted in the <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer/">first teaser for the film</a>, rolling across a desert service, its little motor whirring as it moved as quick as it could. However, we&#8217;ve yet to here what the little droid actually sounds like.</p>
<p>A new commercial for <strong>Star Wars LEGO</strong> sets for <em>The Force Awakens</em> features some quick animation specifically one part with the little droid running from Kylo Ren and some First Order Stormtroopers where we get to hear what BB-8 sounds like for the first time. Check it out below!<span id="more-312174"></span></p>
<p>Now you might be thinking to yourself that we&#8217;ve heard BB-8 in both the <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer/">teaser trailer for <em>The Force Awakens</em></a> and also in his <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/bb-8-effects/">stage appearance from Star Wars Celebration</a>. However, the slight beeping from the teaser and the sounds that were made on stage by the little ball droid were just temporary. We&#8217;ve heard that the final sounds for BB-8 were only recently determined, and this LEGO commercial gives us our first official piece of sound from the droid:</p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6plXGDtM67o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As you hear in the commercial (via <a href="http://www.starwars7news.com/2015/08/star-wars-the-force-awakens-lego-commercial.html">StarWars7News.com</a>), the droid has much more of a whistle sound than the usual beeps and hums that we&#8217;ve heard from astromech droids like R2-D2 before. And if you compare the sounds in the commercial to those made during the Celebration appearance earlier this year, there&#8217;s a distinct difference. The droid sounds super adorable, and I cant wait to hear how he interacts and shows emotion and expresses himself like R2-D2.</p>
<p>But the question is, why is BB-8 running from Kylo Ren and First Order Stormtroopers in this commercial? Well, we likely know the answer, but if you want to be in the dark for the movie, then don&#8217;t read below for fear of <strong>spoilers</strong>!</p>
<p>Thanks to some of the details revealed on the toys, we know that BB-8 belongs to Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (<strong>Oscar Isaac</strong>), not REy (<strong>Daisy Ridley</strong>) as some had assumed. And early on in the film, Dameron comes into possession of Luke/Anakin&#8217;s old lightsaber on Jakku and hides it in BB-8.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Kylo Ren (<strong>Adam Driver</strong>) and the First Order Stormtroopers are looking for the lightsaber, it would stand to reason that BB-8 is likely on the run from the bad guys to avoid being captured. Presumably, the droid escapes the bad guys, but ends up getting captured by some kind of scavenger, and that&#8217;s how Rey comes into contact with the droid (as we&#8217;ve seen in a <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-7-photos/">previously released photo</a>). And that&#8217;s how Rey ends up in possession of the lightsaber, though as we&#8217;ve seen, Finn (<strong>John Boyega</strong>) <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/the-force-awakens-footage/">ends up using it at some point</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, even though we can start to piece some of the story together in <em>The Force Awakens</em>, there&#8217;s still so much we don&#8217;t know, which is simultaneously frustrating and exciting. Stay tuned for anymore Star Wars information that comes to light.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/americanhorrorstory-logo.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-312150 aligncenter" src="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/americanhorrorstory-logo-700x279.jpg?resize=700%2C279" alt="American Horror Story two seasons in 2016" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Ever since the anthology series <strong><em>American Horror Story</em></strong> began in 2011, we&#8217;ve gotten a single season each year, composed of 13 episodes (except the first season which only had 12 episodes). But that might change in 2016.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, series creator and executive producer <strong>Ryan Murphy</strong> says that he and the writing team are considering giving <em>American Horror Story</em> <strong>two seasons</strong> in 2016, but nothing is set in stone just yet.<span id="more-312147"></span></p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/27/american-horror-story-two-seasons-2016">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Murphy teased:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Next year we might do a fall <em>American Horror Story</em> and a spring. We have to decide.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That decision would likely have to be made pretty quickly if they&#8217;re going to get a start on a season for spring 2016, before the usual fall premiere of <em>American Horror Story</em>. So what brought about this possible doubling up on American Horror Story, besides the fact that FX is probably happy to get twice the dose of horror for fans of the anthology show?</p>
<p>Murphy says the way they&#8217;re writing the show now may make it easier to pump out two seasons for 2016. Here&#8217;s what the executive producer said about how <strong><em>American Horror Story: Hotel</em></strong> is being done this season, and what we can expect from the next iteration of the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re doing something that we’ve never done before on the show where we’re doing two different groups of writers rooms. Some of our writers will be bouncing around but a whole different group coming in late August. The next thing we’re crafting up is very, very different than this. Not smaller. But just not opulent. More rogue and more dark.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this will fix some of the complaints that even big fans have had about how out of hand and off the wall <em>American Horror Story</em> has gotten since the <em>Coven</em> season. The series seems to lack consistently and follow through with a lot of the elements of the show, with writers often throwing anything and everything into a season, and seeing what works. It makes for some pretty crazy twists and turns, but it also feels very slapdash.</p>
<p>But with two writers&#8217; rooms, maybe there will be a better system of checks and balances to make sure that things to get too nuts on the show. After all, we know the show can churn out some completely bonkers stuff and make it work because <em>American Horror Story: Asylum</em> had Santa Claus killers, skin-wearing psychiatrist murderers, nuns possessed by demons, Nazi scientists and even aliens, and fans loved that stuff.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here&#8217;s a gallery of photos of <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> on the forthcoming <em>American Horror Story: Hotel</em>:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Andrew-Garfield-in-Amazing-Spider-Man.jpeg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-279430 aligncenter" src="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Andrew-Garfield-in-Amazing-Spider-Man-700x359.jpeg?resize=700%2C359" alt="Spider-Man Avengers crossover" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that while <strong>Andrew Garfield</strong> took residence in New York City as <strong><em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em></strong>, he wanted our friendly neighborhood wallcrawler to end up meeting with <strong>The Avengers</strong> in the Marvel cinematic universe. The actor mentioned as much when asked about the possibility <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/the-amazing-spider-man-2-comic-con-panel-andrew-garfield-wants-to-be-part-of-the-avengers-plus-rhino-and-electro-details/">at Comic-Con back in 2013</a>, but sadly his time as Spider-Man has come to an end.</p>
<p>But besides a desire to team up with The Avengers, it turns out Andrew Garfield was actively trying to make some kind of crossover happen ever since he took the role of Spidey. Find out more about the Amazing Spider-Man Avengers crossover efforts below!<span id="more-312141"></span></p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="http://uproxx.com/movies/2015/08/andrew-garfield-spider-man-marvel/">Uproxx</a> while promoting <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/99-homes-trailer/">his indie drama <em>99 Homes</em></a>, Garfield talked a bit about his attempts to bring Spider-Man into the Marvel cinematic universe. Unfortunately, he&#8217;s being hush-hush about some of the finer details of what happened behind the scenes, but here&#8217;s what Garfield had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been petitioning to hook up with Marvel since the beginning, so I’m really glad they’re finally doing it&#8230;To be honest [pauses], all the ins and outs of what happened is a more tender conversation that maybe I don’t want to talk about in public in a press situation. But all I can say is that I’m stoked to go and watch a Marvel film of Spider-Man.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That definitely sounds like he doesn&#8217;t want to ruffle any feathers or bring up any potentially controversial details from behind the scenes, but it&#8217;s good to know that Garfield was so invested in making Spider-Man something great that he knew the hero needed to hook up with The Avengers right from the beginning. Honestly, it&#8217;s a little disappointing that we won&#8217;t get to see Garfield&#8217;s version of Spider-Man, easily the best part of the short-lived reboot franchise, in the MCU.</p>
<p>So where was he at with <strong><em>The Amazing Spider-Man 3</em></strong> before it got canned in favor of the reboot coming in 2017? Garfield was actually pretty hands-on with the story, working with writer <strong>Alex Kurtzman</strong> on what the next chapter would entail:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was actually starting to workshop ideas with Alex Kurtzman, who was going to be writing it. We thought to kind of start from the base level, the foundational level of where have we left Peter and where do we want to see him go and what’s logical. And how do we build upon where we left off with this deep, desperate moment with Gwen? So, yeah, we got to some pretty heavy places and I was really excited to kind of explore it and be involved on the ground level like that. But, anyway, it wasn’t meant to be. As I say, I’m just really excited that I get to watch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s good to hear that he&#8217;s not bitter about the whole situation, but at the same time, I&#8217;m sure he knows that putting on a happy face about the situation is about the best thing he can do. You don&#8217;t want to be the bitter actor who&#8217;s upset because their franchise didn&#8217;t work out, because then that just gives you a bad reputation as someone who lives in the past and constantly whines about it. Even so, Garfield is probably just thankful he got to make one of his dreams come true, even if it didn&#8217;t turn out that great for fans of the superhero.</p>
<p>As for the reboot of <strong><em>Spider-Man</em></strong> starring <strong>Tom Holland</strong>, Sony Pictures has that slated to arrive on <strong>July 28th, 2017</strong>. But we&#8217;ll see Spider-Man <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-civil-war/">pop up in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a> over a year before that on <strong>May 6th, 2016</strong>. Stay tuned.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/armiehammer-socialnetwork.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-312139 aligncenter" src="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/armiehammer-socialnetwork-700x329.jpg?resize=700%2C329" alt="Armie Hammer joining Nocturnal Animals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>After becoming a 1960s Russian spy in <em>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</em> earlier this year, <strong>Armie Hammer</strong> joining <strong><em>Nocturnal Animals</em></strong>, a dramatic tale of a story within a story that is the next film from <em>A Single Man</em> director <strong>Tom Ford</strong>.</p>
<p>Focus Features is behind the production based on Austin Wright&#8217;s novel <em>Tony and Susan</em>, and Hammer has a key role in the that focuses on a woman (<strong>Amy Adams</strong>) who receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband, a man whom she left 20 years earlier, asking for her opinion. And then things take an interesting turn.<span id="more-312138"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the synopsis of the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fifteen years ago, Susan Morrow left her first husband Edward Sheffield, an unpublished writer. Now, she’s enduring middle class suburbia as a doctor’s wife, when out of the blue she receives a package containing the manuscript of her ex-husband’s first novel. He writes asking her to read the book; she was always his best critic, he says.</p>
<p>As Susan reads, she is drawn into the fictional life of Tony Hastings, a math professor driving his family to their summer house in Maine. And as we read with her, we too become lost in Sheffield’s thriller. As the Hastings’ ordinary, civilized lives are disastrously, violently sent off course, Susan is plunged back into the past, forced to confront the darkness that inhabits her, and driven to name the fear that gnaws at her future and will change her life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The synopsis actually reminds me of the short story <a href="https://collegelit2014.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/the-continuity-of-parks.pdf">&#8220;Continuity of Parks&#8221; by Julio Cortázar</a>, which also weaves one story of a man reading a novel into the story of the novel that the character is reading. But in that short story, the man at the center of the tale ends up being part of the story himself. And I&#8217;m not sure that will end up happening in <em>Nocturnal Animals</em> (the movie, not the book in the movie).</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s Hammer&#8217;s role in this? <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/armie-hammer-joins-amy-adams-818620">THR</a> reports he will be playing Adams&#8217; husband. And I think that means her current husband, not her ex-husband who is giving her the manuscript, but I can&#8217;t be sure. The rest of the cast includes <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Michael Shannon</strong> and<strong> Kim Basinger</strong>, so this should be quite the compelling drama.</p>
<p>Production is slated to begin this fall and the film will likely end up hitting theaters sometime in 2016. Considering how good Ford&#8217;s directorial debut was with <em>A Single Man</em>, I&#8217;m anxious to see what he does with his sophomore effort behind the camera.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-312133" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/the-shield-700x263.jpg?resize=700%2C263" alt="The Shield remasters" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Old TV shows are being remastered now and again for new blu-ray and streaming presentations, but it isn&#8217;t often that a company really puts out the time and resources to do the job correctly. Just look at what happened with <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, where widescreen transfers were created seemingly by an automated process, revealing set edges, crew members, and equipment that were originally cropped out of the image.</p>
<p>The latest series to get a remaster is <strong><em>The Shield</em></strong>, which originally debuted in 2002 with <strong>Michael Chiklis</strong> starring as the complex character Vic Mackey, and which is often considered one of the best shows of the past couple decades.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s good news! According to series creator <strong>Shawn Ryan</strong>, the new 4K transfer &#8220;really looks spectacular,&#8221; meaning this is probably going to be more like the updated masters for <em>The Wire</em> than the debacle of <em>Buffy</em>.<span id="more-312123"></span></p>
<p>The only downside here is that we&#8217;ll have to wait until 2017 for the new masters, but it&#8217;s good to know that these new masters will be overseen by Ryan, and are not going to scrub away the grit that was an integral part of the show&#8217;s aesthetic. The new transfers will hit both Blu-ray and streaming services.</p>
<p>Ryan tweeted a string of info about the new transfers, so let&#8217;s go right to him for more detail:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. Thrilled to announce that after months of talking/tests that Sony and Fox are moving forward with a 4K conversion of The Shield.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637365716325302272">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2. I was dubious going in since the gritty, grainy look of the show is so essential to its impact. But the tests really won me over.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637365960131776512">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3. Since we filmed on 16mm film and not digitally, Shield is an ideal candidate for this. Plus we always filmed for widescreen safe.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637366185231650816">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4. This will be a big project and will take some time. Current plan is to have all complete by 15th Anniversary of pilot &#8211; March, 2017.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5. I will personally oversee and approve the work on each episode and make sure that the quality is what it needs to be.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6. The tests showed that in 4K the gritty look could be maintained while updating it for a 2015 audience. It really looks spectacular.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637366789526044672">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">7. This conversion will allow for the release of Blu-Ray DVDs as well as comply with most streaming sites that will soon be all 4K.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8. I pushed hard for this and want to thank everyone at Sony and Fox, especially Steve Mosko for making this happen.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">9. I&#39;ve always viewed The Shield as a legacy show and even when we were making it I obsessed with how it would be viewed in 10-15 years.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637367305446404101">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10. This 4K conversion of The Shield will allow it to live on in the digital age and I couldn&#39;t be more excited.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637367443497717760">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">11. Thanks to all Shield fans who clamored for this. Your voices were a big reason why Sony/Fox decided to move forward with this.</p>
<p>&mdash; Shawn Ryan (@ShawnRyanTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnRyanTV/status/637367597164441600">August 28, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I was initially dubious about the new masters of The Wire, which was always originally presented in a 4:3 format. I&#8217;ve been watching the series lately through those new masters, however, and it&#8217;s only rarely that I find myself thinking that a shot feels unnaturally constrained, or that something is really missing.</p>
<p>What Ryan says above, about shooting the film to be widescreen safe, was the process on the latter part of The Wire, too, and that ensures that there&#8217;s plenty of material to fill the widescreen frame in the new masters, and that the composition of each shot won&#8217;t be thrown way off balance by the new look.</p>
<p><em>The Shield</em> ran from 2002 to 2008.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vic Mackey is a rogue cop in an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department, willing to sink to the criminals&#8217; level in order to take them on &#8212; but his misdeeds eventually come home to roost. He<span class="r-ij_NwJWL1xW0 kno-desc-sh"><span class="_dgc"> breaks the law to, in his mind, bring some semblance of order to a chaotic world.</span></span></p></blockquote>

<p>Every story ever told has a beginning, a middle, and a twist, according to <strong>Jack Black</strong>&#8216;s fictionalized version of <strong><em>Goosebumps</em></strong> author <strong>R.L. Stine</strong>. In the film, the twist is that the <em>Goosebumps</em> books are actually prisons for the monsters created by Stine&#8217;s imagination, and opening the books releases the monsters.</p>
<p>A new <em>Goosebumps</em> international trailer is just packed with those monsters, as the books are opened and dozens of creatures escape. There&#8217;s a werewolf, a Yeti, the invisible boy, a giant preying mantis, and plenty more. Check out the footage and all the <em>Goosebumps</em> movie monsters below.<span id="more-312114"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/us73jcBFB_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never read any of these books, as Stine began releasing the novels in 1992, after I was already in college, well out of the range of the original target audience. So I look at this not as an adaptation of any of the books, but simply as a film packed with gags and creatures and Jack Black&#8217;s own brand of comedy. And it seems kind of charming in a slick, effects-heavy Chris Columbus movie sort of way.</p>
<p>That kind of movie usually isn&#8217;t my thing, but monsters definitely are. I&#8217;ll turn up just to watch a giant mantis run rampant in a small town. And I want to know what the heck is going on in the still we&#8217;ve used as the header above &#8212; that&#8217;s an image that could be the basis for an entire movie, as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p><em>Goosebumps</em> opens on October 16. <b>Rob Letterman</b> (<em>Shark Tale</em>, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>) directed. Trailer via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cn716jv61s">Sony</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Upset about moving from a big city to a small town, teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette) finds a silver lining when he meets the beautiful girl, Hannah (Odeya Rush), living right next door. But every silver lining has a cloud, and Zach’s comes when he learns that Hannah has a mysterious dad who is revealed to be R. L. Stine (Jack Black), the author of the bestselling Goosebumps series. It turns out that there is a reason why Stine is so strange… he is a prisoner of his own imagination – the monsters that his books made famous are real, and Stine protects his readers by keeping them locked up in their books. When Zach unintentionally unleashes the monsters from their manuscripts and they begin to terrorize the town, it’s suddenly up to Stine, Zach, and Hannah to get all of them back in the books where they belong.</p></blockquote>

<p>We still don&#8217;t know exactly what happened on <strong>Woody Allen</strong>&#8216;s latest film that led to the departure of <strong><em>Bruce Willis</em></strong>, but in the end the show will go on. Despite having shot some of his scenes, Willis is off the film, and his role will now be played by <strong>Steve Carell</strong>. <span id="more-312102"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://deadline.com/2015/08/steve-carell-replaces-bruce-willis-woody-allen-movie-1201509364/">Deadline</a> reports on the swap. Carell has already been in one of Allen&#8217;s films. He played a small role as Will Ferrell&#8217;s friend in the 2004 film <em>Melinda and Melinda</em>, well before Carell&#8217;s star had risen as a lead on <em>The Office</em> or in movies. At that time, Carell was still a <em>Daily Show</em> cast member.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/bruce-willis-leaving-woody-allen/">persistent rumor</a> that Willis was fired, the party line remains that he left the movie when he determined his schedule for the Broadway version of <em>Misery</em> didn&#8217;t mesh with the requirements for Woody Allen&#8217;s shoot. How that was determined after the shoot had already started is a mystery, but if that&#8217;s the story everyone has agreed to stick with, no big deal. If Allen really did fire him, he&#8217;s being very kind about it by going with the &#8220;bad scheduling&#8221; story.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast of Allen&#8217;s film, which remains untitled at this point (at least as far as the public knows) includes Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Stephen Kunken, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.</p>
<p>This is the second teaming between Allen and Eisenberg, who did <em>To Rome With Love</em> together, and the third picture to pair Eisenberg and Stewart, with the two previous films being <em>Adventureland</em> and the current <em>American Ultra</em>. (Woody Allen has hired some of the other cast members before, too, such as Corey Stoll, who played Ernest Hemingway in <em>Midnight in Paris</em>.)</p>
<p>The film is shooting now in Los Angeles. The untitled movie is produced by Allen&#8217;s regular collaborators Letty Aronson, Steve Tenenbaum and Edward Walson. Executive producers are Ronald L. Chez, Adam B. Stern and Allan Teh. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (<em>Apocalypse Now</em>, <em>The Last Emperor</em>) is shooting the movie.</p>
<p>The film should arrive in theaters in 2016.</p>

<p>Regardless of your feelings about <strong><em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em></strong>, seeing the process of creation for a movie like that one is always fascinating. With so many moving parts to juggle, from actors and their characters and storylines to locations, effects, and all the post-production details, there are innumerable tricks and secrets to learn.</p>
<p>Yesterday we saw an <em>Age of Ultron</em> featurette showing some of the creation of Vision; today we have three more. One explains the effects that brought some powers to life. Two others explore how <strong>James Spader</strong> interacted on set with other actors including <strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong>, <strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong> and <strong>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</strong>. (One neat bit: during takes, they had to use balls mounted a couple feet above Spader&#8217;s head as an eyeline for the giant Ultron.) Watch all three below, and prepare to Marvel at Mark Ruffalo&#8217;s continued astonishment at the particulars of his job.<span id="more-312090"></span></p>
<p>The first of these videos comes via <a href="http://www.ign.com/videos/2015/08/28/marvels-avengers-age-of-ultron-new-powers-blu-ray-featurette">IGN</a>, the following two are direct from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbe7-zit_x0">Marvel</a>.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="416" scrolling="no" src="http://widgets.ign.com/video/embed/content.html?url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2015/08/28/marvels-avengers-age-of-ultron-new-powers-blu-ray-featurette" width="740"></iframe></p>
<p>Here are two videos looking pretty specifically James Spader, Ultron, and actors interacting with the character. My actual favorite line in here comes from Mark Ruffalo, who reflects on his motion-capture time with Spader in awed tones. &#8220;Look at you, Ruffalo,&#8221; he recalls, &#8220;you really pulled one over on the world.&#8221; Can&#8217;t argue with that.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Michael-Jordan-Fantastic-Four-Empire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-282173" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Michael-Jordan-Fantastic-Four-Empire-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="Michael Jordan Fantastic Four Empire" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>After the epic bellyflop that was <em>Fantastic Four</em>, you&#8217;d think <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> would want to stay away from comic book movies for a while. But perhaps he subscribes to the &#8220;if at first you don&#8217;t succeed&#8230;&#8221; mantra.</p>
<p>Jordan has just entered negotiations to star in <strong><em>Blood Brothers</em></strong>, MGM&#8217;s buddy action-comedy based on the Dark Horse graphic novel of the same name. Get details on the Michael B Jordan <em>Blood Brothers</em> movie after the jump. <span id="more-312050"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tracking-board.com/tb-exclusive-michael-b-jordan-in-talks-for-mgms-vampire-comedy-blood-brothers/">The Tracking Board</a> first reported the news. No director has been set. Here&#8217;s the synopsis for the <em>Blood Brothers</em> comic:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a century of friendship, smoking opium with Genghis Khan and having orgies in Michelangelo’s studio, two inseparable vampire buddies are on the verge of splitting up. Terrible timing, as an apocalypse-obsessed villain is plotting an end to humanity. Looks like Nick and Tree, immortal best buds getting by as bail bondsmen, are humanity’s last hope&#8230; Can they put their baggage aside long enough to save the world?</p></blockquote>
<p>While the <em>Fantastic Four</em> disaster sparked a blame game between director Josh Trank and studio 20th Century Fox, the stars thankfully seem to have come out unscathed. Jordan should have no trouble bouncing back with this winter&#8217;s <em>Creed</em>, which reunites him with <em>Fruitvale Station</em> helmer Ryan Coogler. In addition, he recently <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/just-mercy-movie/">attached himself</a> to <em>Just Mercy</em>, from <em>Short Term 12</em> director Destin Cretton.</p>
<p>Jordan broke through with roles in <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, and then crossed over into films with <em>Chronicle</em> and <em>Fruitvale Station</em> before booking his first big superhero role in <i>Fantastic Four</i>. He hasn&#8217;t done much in the way of comedy, aside from the dud that was <i>That Awkward Moment</i>. <em>Blood Brothers</em> should be a welcome opportunity to mix up his heavier stuff with some lighter material.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve heard over and over that the characters from <strong><em>The Walking Dead</em></strong> won&#8217;t cross over with those in spin-off/prequel show <strong><em>Fear the Walking Dead</em></strong>. But there is something happening with the timelines of the two shows, and now we have word of a new intersection between the series.</p>
<p>A special web series will take place during the <em>Fear</em> timeline &#8212; that is, in the earliest days of the walker outbreak. But it will be a little more walker-centric, as the series takes place on an airplane as walkers attack passengers.<span id="more-312064"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/28/walking-dead-airline">EW</a> has the report. The site&#8217;s language is a bit confusing, calling this as-yet-untitled thing both a one-off special and a web series. It&#8217;s basically a half-hour special that will be broken up into chunks that will air both online and during commercial breaks for <em>The Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the details of the series are unknown, but here&#8217;s one thing we do know: one character who survives the in-flight attack will become a cast member of <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em> season 2.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know who that character is or who will play the role, and we don&#8217;t even know the title of this special / web series, or details of the flight. Since one of the passengers becomes a Fear the Walking Dead cast member eventually, it is probably headed to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We also don&#8217;t know how many chapters the 30-minute special will be broken into, or precisely when they&#8217;ll air. In fact, that may not all be decided yet; AMC reps tell <a href="http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/walking-dead-plane-webseries-fear-the-walking-dead-crossover-1201580779/">Variety</a> that a lot of decisions are still being made on that front. This isn&#8217;t the first <em>Walking Dead</em> web series, but it does seem like the highest-profile one AMC has planned out.</p>
<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> returns on October 11 for it&#8217;s sixth season, with the real impact of the mysterious Wolves tribe being felt. Meanwhile, the new series <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em> recently debuted and is airing weekly now. It had a record viewership of 13.3 million viewers. This <em>Walking Dead</em> special will be produced by <em>Fear</em> showrunner Dave Erickson and co-executive producer David Weiner.</p>

<p>Planning to attend <strong>Star Wars Celebration Europe</strong> in London next summer? If you don&#8217;t already have tickets, you may have just hit a speed bump. Saturday adult tickets for the event have sold out already, as announced on Facebook. Three-day passes sold out last month.</p>

<p>Friday and Sunday passes are still available. And ticket holders are allowed to sell their passes if they can&#8217;t go, so you might luck out if someone you know changes their plans. But if you haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets already, you&#8217;ll definitely want to figure something out ASAP.</p>

<p>Lucasfilm’s brand creative director <strong>Hez Chorba</strong> and Avalanche Software&#8217;s vice president of art development for Disney Infinity <strong>Jeff Bunker</strong> talk about the challenges and the process of bringing <em><strong>Star Wars Rebels</strong></em> characters to life in <em><strong>Disney Infinity 3.0</strong></em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Early on,” Chorba explains, “we got to a philosophical way of working. I work with a lot of teams this way, whether it’s on Battlefront or Infinity: We always envision the characters as real human beings.” This methodology levels the playing field, essentially; if all Star Wars characters have real-world counterparts, they can be adapted to the same style in another medium. “When we go and look at the Infinity style,” Chorba continues, “we go, ‘What would these characters look like if they were photo-real?’ and we build down. Sometimes we might take photographs of people that look like these characters. This was a unique challenge with Rebels, because these characters are brand new. We had no live-action reference.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Disney XD has yet to announce when <strong><em>Star Wars Rebels</em></strong> will return, but a leaked trailer may have given it away. While the video itself has been yanked, the screenshots below (via <a href="http://www.starwarsunderworld.com/2015/08/report-star-wars-rebels-season-two-to.html">Star Wars Underworld</a>) suggest we can expect Season 2 to hit <strong>October 14</strong>.</p>

<p>Those attending New York Comic-Con will be able to see the <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> Season 2 premiere even earlier, as the first two episodes will be screened there October 8. Expect an official date announcement from Disney XD soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>We already <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-bits-23/">tipped you off</a> to plans to hand out Drew Struzan&#8217;s <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> poster in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco on <strong>Force Friday</strong>. But even the Disney stores not involved with that particular promotion are going big. The Disney Store on Chicago&#8217;s North Michigan Avenue will play host to one of the unboxing events, broadcast live on YouTube&#8217;s HobbyKidsTV.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at all Disney Stores, the first 100 guests to make a purchase will get free commemorative Force Awakens pins, and customers can enjoy story time, craft activities, a Topps vintage trading card giveaway, and more. Get all the details at <a href="http://www.disneystore.com/force-friday/mn/1025030/">DisneyStore.com</a> (via <a href="http://www.rebelscum.com/story/front/Star_Wars_Force_Friday_Event_Announced_For_Disney_Store_165574.asp">Rebel Scum</a>).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-312058" src="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/sisters-brothers-700-700x375.jpg?resize=700%2C375" alt="Sisters Brothers movie" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best indie film news of the week: <em>A Prophet</em> and <em>Dheepan</em> director <strong>Jacques Audiard</strong> is now going to direct the adaptation of a weird, funny, and touching Western novel called <strong><em>The Sisters Brothers</em></strong>. I love this book, which is set during the Gold Rush of 1851, and follows a violent pair of siblings as their contract-killing gig leads them to a man with an unusual plan to find gold.</p>
<p><strong>John C. Reilly</strong> optioned the novel rights back in 2011, and he&#8217;ll be one of the two stars of the film, which will also be Audiard&#8217;s first English-language movie.<span id="more-312044"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/palme-dor-winner-jacques-audiard-817151">THR</a> had the news earlier this week, which we somehow overlooked at the time. Reilly and Patrick DeWitt first worked together on the 2011 film <em>Terri</em>, which the author <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/tag/patrick-dewitt/">wrote</a> and which featured Reilly in a lead role. Presumably that led to Reilly optioning this novel, as the film rights were already in his company&#8217;s possession when the book was published.</p>
<p>A friend recommended <em>The Sisters Brothers</em> to me a year or two ago and I devoured it quickly. DeWitt&#8217;s language is compelling and straightforward. The book is structured around a simple, propulsive story that follows the narrator, Eli Sisters, and his brother Charlie as they pursue a man marked for death by their boss, known only as the Commodore. As much as I liked the book, it feels like a movie-in-waiting, so this development is perfect.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also more to the novel than the simple chase plot. Eli&#8217;s narration reveals his own deep concerns about the violent work undertaken by he and his brother, and also details Eli&#8217;s insecurities and ambitions, especially as they relate to his complicated relationship with his domineering and attractive brother.</p>
<p>Reilly will presumably play Eli, and we don&#8217;t yet know who will play Charlie. I can see quite a few options in my head, but I&#8217;d love to see someone like Jon Hamm, who could be both cruel and charismatic enough to play the character. (The argument could be made, however, that Charlie is too much like an Old West version of Don Draper to be attractive to Hamm.)</p>
<p>One challenge in the adaptation is the same one that crops up when bringing many novels to the screen: translating Eli&#8217;s inner narration to something that comes forward in dialogue. There could easily be a lot of voiceover in the film, but with Reilly playing the lead role, and a strong actor opposite him, Audiard could really do something unique and special with this story.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-310127" src="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/rogueone-castphoto-frontpage-700x356.jpg?resize=700%2C356" alt="Rogue One 70mm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong> has long been a film series that helped push technology forward, beginning with the original 1977 film. That movie was a pioneer in visual effects, with the first large-scale use of motion-control camera systems, and also helped push Dolby Stereo into theaters. But one of the new <em>Star Wars</em> films might be using a fusion of old and new gear to create its own spectacle.</p>
<p>There are reports that <strong><em>Star Wars: Rogue One</em></strong> will be using the same anamorphic Ultra Panavision 70 lenses that Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/hateful-eight-70mm/">used</a> on <em>The Hateful Eight</em>, lenses which prior to that movie hadn&#8217;t been used in decades. <em>Rogue One</em> probably won&#8217;t use 65mm film, as Tarantino&#8217;s movie did, but a union of those lenses and the new Arri Alexa 65mm digital camera to create the widest <em>Star Wars</em> spectacle we&#8217;ve yet seen.<span id="more-312008"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-might-be-shot-in-panavision-70-20150828">The Playlist</a> pushes the story forward, though we first hear (and commented on) it months ago when <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/cine-gear-expo-hateful-eight-800623">THR</a> reported that <em>Rogue One</em> cinematographer <strong>Greig Fraser</strong> would be using the Ultra Panavision 70 lenses on <em>Rogue One</em>.</p>
<p>As far as we know, however, <em>Rogue One</em> isn&#8217;t shooting on film, but is using the new Arri Alexa 65 large-format 6K digital camera for at least some sequences. That&#8217;s the same system <a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2015/02/emmanuel-lubezki-using-arri-alexa-65-inarritu-revenant">used for some of</a> <em>The Revenant</em>, and which is also the base unit that was customized to be the new <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/new-imax-camera/">IMAX-branded digital camera</a> used for parts of <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the appeal? We talk a lot about the advantages of 65mm film and large-format IMAX film, and essentially it all means that you&#8217;ve got a larger surface area to capture the image, so the resulting footage is particularly fine and detailed, especially when blown up to cinema or proper IMAX size.</p>
<p>This Alexa 65 is an attempt to create a digital camera that has the same effect, but with all the advantages of digital. In the end you may not see much of a difference on regular cinema screens, but if you catch <em>Rogue One</em> in IMAX (which, given the release plan for <em>The Force Awakens</em> should absolutely be a possibility) the advantages of the Alexa 65 image could be spectacular.</p>
<p>The key point here is really the lenses, since a camera is really only as good as the lenses mounted on it. There are two basic lens types, &#8220;spherical,&#8221; and &#8220;anamorphic.&#8221; Spherical lenses are basically the sort of lens you&#8217;d have on any regular camera. Anamorphic lenses stretch the image vertically in order to use more of the film surface area.</p>
<p>The image below shows a film frame with a spherical lens capture (and optical soundtrack area) on the left, and the anamorphic on the right. The one on the right uses far more film surface area, and so captures more information. During projection, anamorphic lenses stretch out the image to remove the vertical distortion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-312028" src="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/anamorphic-demo-700x194.jpg?resize=700%2C194" alt="anamorphic-demo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Anamorphic cinematography is also associated with widescreen cinema, as its popular use came about as companies sought ways to create ever-wide images on the cinema screen without having to install all-new projection equipment. The compression created by an anamorphic lens allows a widescreen image to be captured on a standard film frame. What you get is typically Cinemascope, with a 2.35:1 ratio.</p>
<p>The Ultra Panavision 70 lenses used by Robert Richardson on <em>The Hateful Eight</em> yield an extremely wide aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when used with a 65mm capture area, which is quite a bit more wide than the widest standard anamorphic widescreen ratio of 2.39:1.  The result is an unusually detailed ultra-widescreen image.</p>
<p>Our current standard for really big cinema is the full-format IMAX, but the effect here is to go really wide, rather than closer to square as IMAX does. <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/hateful-eight-trailer/">You can see the result in <em>The Hateful Eight</em> trailer</a>, which shows the ultra-widescreen image. Now imagine that projected on a massive screen&#8230; then imagine the same ultra-widescreen effect used for the landscapes and battles of a <em>Star Wars</em> film.</p>
<p>And since we&#8217;ve heard that <em>Rogue One</em> also wants to be, in some ways, <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-rogue-one-plot/">the most grounded <em>Star Wars</em> film yet</a>, that&#8217;s an interesting contrast. Ultra-widescreen images could really push a sense of unusual spectacle even as the core characters and storytelling remains a bit rooted in &#8220;reality.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><em>Rogue One</em> stars <b>Felicity Jones</b>, <b>Riz Ahmed</b>,<b> Diego Luna</b>, <b>Donnie Yen</b>,<b> Jiang Wen</b>, <b>Mads Mikkelsen</b>, and <b>Alan Tudyk.</b> It opens on December 16, 2016.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/bigbangtheory-sheldon-deathstar.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-312016 aligncenter" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/bigbangtheory-sheldon-deathstar-700x350.jpg?resize=700%2C350" alt="The Big Bang Theory The Force Awakens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The entire world will slowly be overtaken by <em><strong>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</strong></em> as the film&#8217;s December 18th release gets closer. Fans of the saga and plenty of average filmgoers can&#8217;t wait to see what <em>Episode VII</em> offers, and that also stands true for the fictional characters of <strong><em>The Big Bang Theory</em></strong> who are obsessed with everything from a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>The CBS comedy series, returning in the fall for its ninth season, will indeed be impacted by the release of the new <em>Star Wars</em> movie, and executive producer <strong>Steve Molaro</strong> confirms that they&#8217;re trying to figure out how the impending release of The Force Awakens will be weaved into Sheldon (<strong>Jim Parsons</strong>), Leonard (<strong>Johnny Galecki</strong>), Howard (<strong>Simon Helberg</strong>) and Raj’s (<strong>Kunal Nayyar</strong>) lives.</p>
<p>Find out more about The Big Bang Theory Force Awakens plans after the jump!<span id="more-312007"></span></p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="http://tvline.com/2015/08/28/the-big-bang-theory-the-force-awakens-season-9-star-wars/">TV Line</a>, Molaro said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re talking about how that will be weaved into [the guys’] lives. And we have some really cool ideas. Obviously, we’re all excited about it, just as human beings — and the characters are as well. I don”t know exactly how it’s going to play in, but it won’t be ignored.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One would hope that the actual release of the movie would come into play at some point. However, the trick there is that the episodes that are release in December would be written long before the actual movie comes out, so they won&#8217;t really be able to get too specific when it comes to talking about the movie at the time it hits theaters.</p>
<p>But since Force Friday is coming up, and plenty of new tidbits will be released over the next couple months, the writing staff of <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> should have plenty to play with in order to talk about The Force Awakens on the show.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time<em> Star Wars</em> has had a big presence on the show. Previously, an episode that aired around Star Wars Day in 2014 had a strong <em>Star Wars</em> influence. The episode, entitled &#8220;The Proton Transmogrification&#8221; had a dream sequence with Sheldon appearing on a Dagobah film set that was overseen by Lucasfilm, with Bob Newhart appearing like the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Check that clip out right here:</p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcAw6mSzT-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, <strong>James Earl Jones</strong> (the voice of Darth Vader) and <strong>Carrie Fisher</strong> (Princess Leia) have both guest starred on the show, specifically in the episode &#8220;The Convention Conundrum.&#8221; And with that kind of Star Wars presence on the show, Molaro acknowledges that it would be weird if The Force Awakens wasn&#8217;t mentioned at all this season.</p>
<p>Fans of <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> know that Leonard and Penny (<strong>Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting</strong>) are supposed to be getting married, so perhaps tying a wedding to the release of <em>The Force Awakens</em> for a mid-season finale could be something that happens. At this point, as much as these characters love <em>Star Wars</em>, anything is possible.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&#8217;m not a huge <em>Big Bang Theory</em> fan, and not even the allure of <em>The Force Awakens</em> somehow being incorporated into the show will get me to watch. Mostly I don&#8217;t like the multi-camera, live audience format, and it just feels artificially nerdy to me. But I understand why it has such a huge following, and they&#8217;ll surely find plenty to love when <em>Star Wars</em> starts shaking up this season.</p>
<p><em>The Big Bang Theory</em> returns on CBS on <strong>September 21st</strong>.</p>

<p>Fox Searchlight is on a roll this week. Amid all the <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/the-force-awakens-footage/"><em>Star Wars</em></a>, <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/tag/captain-america-civil-war/"><em>Civil War</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/suicide-squad-wraps-shooting/"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a> hype, they managed to capture our attention with the uplifting <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/he-named-me-malala-trailer/"><em>He Named Me Malala</em> trailer</a>, and now again with <strong>Paolo Sorrentino</strong>&#8216;s gorgeous <em><strong>Youth</strong></em> trailer.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Caine</strong> and <strong>Harvey Keitel</strong> star as best friends Fred and Mick, who go on a vacation to the Swiss Alps with Fred&#8217;s daughter Lena (<strong>Rachel Weisz</strong>). While Mick&#8217;s still plugging away at his final screenplay, Fred&#8217;s a renowned orchestra composer who&#8217;s entered retirement &#8212; but then Fred gets an invitation to perform for Queen Elizabeth II. <strong>Paul Dano</strong> and <b>Jane Fonda</b> also star. Watch the <em>Youth</em> trailer after the jump. <span id="more-312000"></span></p>
<p>Fox Searchlight debuted the <em>Youth</em> trailer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJNxQ8Wzr2I">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zJNxQ8Wzr2I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>There are some funny moments here, and <em>Last Vegas</em>-worthy shots of older guys ogling beautiful young women, but for the most part this looks like an emotional, even melancholy affair. <em>Youth</em> got warm reviews at Cannes earlier this year (though <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/youth-cannes-review-michael-caine-hits-career-best-in-melancholy-stunner/">TheWrap</a> notes there were some boos, but that&#8217;s <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/56715/15-movies-were-booed-cannes-film-festival">kind of a Cannes tradition</a>). It&#8217;s clearly gorgeous to look at, and it&#8217;s got a bang-up cast exploring rich themes. You could do worse as a palate cleanser before diving into all that <i>Force Awakens</i> madness.</p>
<p><em>Youth</em> arrives <strong>December 4</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>From Paolo Sorrentino, the director of Italy’s Oscar foreign language winner THE GREAT BEAUTY comes YOUTH, about two longtime friends vacationing in the Swiss Alps. Oscar winning actor Michael Caine plays Fred, an acclaimed composer and conductor, who brings along his daughter (Rachel Weisz) and best friend Mick (Harvey Keitel), a renowned filmmaker. While Mick scrambles to finish the screenplay for what he imagines will be his last important film, Fred has no intention of resuming his musical career. The two men reflect on their past, each finding that some of the most important experiences can come later in life.</p></blockquote>

<p>As we hope that some upcoming video game movies will break the mold of underwhelming adaptations that has defined video game films since the 90s, one more has been tossed on to the growing pile of forthcoming video game-based projects.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>Lionsgate</strong> has announced that they&#8217;re developing a <strong><em>Borderlands</em></strong> movie. It&#8217;s based on the RPG/first-person shooter combo game that follows a group of stranded colonists on an alien planet that has been left for dead, and is slowly moving closer to the sun, sparking the rise of horrifying creatures to wreak havoc on those left behind.<span id="more-311994"></span></p>
<p>Spider-Man franchise producer <strong>Avi Arad</strong> and his son <strong>Ari Arad</strong> are producing the Borderlands movie, adding to Arad&#8217;s flood of video game movies in the works <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/producer-avi-arad-says-uncharted-movie-will-hit-first-followed-by-metal-gear-solid-and-mass-effect/">that also include <em>Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em></a>. Since this is just an announcement of development, there&#8217;s no guarantee that this project won&#8217;t be stuck for a while just like the other video game adaptations, but fans will likely be excited to hear that a movie is in the works.</p>
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the game, here&#8217;s the official description of the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a distant future, the planets at the outer edges of the galaxy have become a beacon to fortune seekers and those yearning for a better life off world. But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet’s huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora.</p></blockquote>
<p>The game is made to be played ideally as a co-op multiplayer experience with characters leveling up, obtaining thousands of weapons and driving cool vehicles across the harsh landscape. The 2009 game spawned a sequel in 2012 and also something called a pre-sequel in 2014, not to mention several expansion packs, and it&#8217;s one of the more beloved games of the previous generation of game systems.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a trailer for the first game so you can get an idea of what this is like:</p>
<p><iframe width="740" height="416" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpO2CCxH_D4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>While the premise sounds like it would make a great sci-fi movie, this also seems like the kind of game that has so much customization and personal investment with your own character that creating a movie may not be the most satisfying experience with fans of the game. You can only have so many characters and so many weapons from the game make their way into the movie.</p>
<p>But Lionsgate seems to think they can make it work as their Motion Picture Group Co-Chairs Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We believe that we’ve brought together the right partners, the ideal creative team and the perfect property to launch a new motion picture tent-pole for a global audience. Part of our strategy in entering the game space under Peter Levin has been to source new brands with built-in audiences that will translate into great films and television shows. The ‘Borderlands’ games don’t pull any punches, and we’ll make the movie with the same in-your-face attitude that has made the series a blockbuster mega-franchise.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that mean we could get an R-rated <em>Borderlands</em> movie? After all the game is rated M for Mature, so it would stand to reason that the best way to bring that spirit to the big screen is with an R-rated movie. But since this project just began development, we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see how it develops.</p>
<p>(There were quite a few people earlier this year who, not knowing history and context, assumed <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> was ripped off from <em>Borderlands</em>. Just search Twitter for comments featuring both titles and you&#8217;ll see loads of assumptions.)</p>
<p>Anyone out there excited to see a <em>Borderlands</em> movie?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Mission-Impossible-Rogue-Nation-BTS.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-306424" src="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Mission-Impossible-Rogue-Nation-BTS-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – ROGUE NATION" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two decades and five installments in, the <strong><em>Mission: Impossible</em></strong> franchise might be stronger than ever. In part, that&#8217;s because of the series&#8217; commitment to working with great directors who put their own stamp on the series. The most recent, <em>Rogue Nation</em>, was helmed by <em>Jack Reacher</em>&#8216;s Chris McQuarrie, following in the footsteps of Brad Bird, J.J. Abrams, John Woo, and Brian De Palma.</p>
<p>The series has never worked with the same director twice, and McQuarrie hasn&#8217;t yet given any indication that he&#8217;ll be the exception. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">So n</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">aturally, that&#8217;s had us wondering who should be the next to take their turn at the helm. Read our <em>Mission Impossible 6</em> director wishlist after the jump.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-311706"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/The-Wachowskis-Jupiter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-278449" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/The-Wachowskis-Jupiter-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="The Wachowskis Jupiter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Andy &amp; Lana Wachowski</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just get it out of the way: This one is not gonna happen. The Wachowskis are almost certainly too busy these days churning out wildly ambitious, arguably nonsensical sci-fi epics to bother with a run-of-the-mill spy thriller.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a moment to pretend they would. The sibs&#8217; action cred is indisputable. <em>The Matrix</em>&#8216;s &#8220;bullet time&#8221; feels like a cliche now, but was groundbreaking at the time. <em>Speed Racer</em> was candy-colored action on a sugar high. Even <em>Jupiter Ascending</em>, for all its narrative missteps, featured some of the most beautiful imagery we&#8217;ve seen onscreen this year. Should the Wachowskis want to try their hand at a plain-Jane spy thriller, we&#8217;d be the first in line for tickets.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Kathryn-Bigelow-Zero-Dark-Thirty1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-311979" src="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Kathryn-Bigelow-Zero-Dark-Thirty1-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="Kathryn Bigelow Zero Dark Thirty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Kathryn Bigelow</strong></p>
<p>Also not terribly likely to happen. Kathryn Bigelow has burnished her reputation as a prestige filmmaker on the strength of politically relevant war dramas like <em>The Hurt Locker</em> and <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>. It&#8217;s hard to imagine her changing course now for a fluffy popcorn flick like <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.</p>
<p>If she decided to, though? Bigelow is a fantastic action director. Both <em>The Hurt Locker</em> and <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> benefited from her ability to put the audience right in the middle of the madness. And she can definitely craft movies that are just plain fun; there&#8217;s a reason <em>Point Break</em> still holds up after all these years.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Steven-Soderbergh-Haywire.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-311980" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Steven-Soderbergh-Haywire-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="Steven Soderbergh Haywire" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Steven Soderbergh</strong></p>
<p>Few films of the past five years did a better job of capturing the joy of movement than Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Haywire</em> and <em>Magic Mike</em>. So many modern action filmmakers try to mask half-assed choreography or create a false sense of momentum with frenetic camerawork; Soderbergh knows when to sit back and let audiences revel in the masterful action work on display. And while those two films were a bit slower paced than your typical <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie, anyone who&#8217;s seen the <em>Ocean&#8217;s</em> films (so: everyone) is aware he can also do zippy and witty when the occasion calls.</p>
<p>The only problem, of course, is that Soderbergh is still technically retired from films. Perhaps we&#8217;d be better off suggesting <em>Magic Mike XXL</em>&#8216;s Gregory Jacobs instead?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Phil-Lord-and-Chris-Miller-Lego-Movie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-homepage crop 700 wp-image-311982" src="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Phil-Lord-and-Chris-Miller-Lego-Movie-700x300.jpg?resize=700%2C300" alt="Phil Lord, Chris Miller, Chris Pratt - Lego Movie" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Phil Lord &amp; Chris Miller</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, we&#8217;d watch anything directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller at this point. A <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie would play off their strengths, while simultaneously taking them into new territory. Their kinetic <em>Lego Movie</em> displayed a great eye for motion, but they haven&#8217;t had the opportunity direct real large-scale action. The <em>Jump Street</em> films demonstrated their ability to let movie stars do what they do best &#8212; charm the hell out of the audience &#8212; but they&#8217;re more famous for comedy than cool. And best of all, they&#8217;re not the kind of filmmakers to take the easy, expected route, so we&#8217;ll know to expect something unique and unexpected from them.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/joecarnahan-featurette.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-311990 aligncenter" src="http://i0.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/joecarnahan-featurette-700x358.jpg?resize=700%2C358" alt="Five Against a Bullet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>About three and a half years ago, <strong>Bruce Willis</strong> <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/bruce-willis-five-bullet/">became attached to</a> <strong><em>Five Against a Bullet</em></strong>, an action thriller formerly set up at Columbia Pictures from <em>Transformers</em> and<em> G.I. Joe</em> franchise producer <strong>Lorenzo DiBonaventura</strong>. Then just last year, <em>The A-Team</em> and <em>Smokin&#8217; Aces</em> director <strong>Joe Carnahan</strong> <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/joe-carnahan-five-against-a-bullet/">came on board the project</a>. However, one of them has fallen away.</p>
<p>Joe Carnahan is still attached to direct the film, but it appears Bruce Willis (who <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/bruce-willis-leaving-woody-allen/">may or may not have been fired</a> from Woody Allen&#8217;s next movie) is no longer part of the movie. The film is also now set up at the new Suretone Pictures banner, a venture from former Geffen Records president <strong>Jordan Schur</strong>. Find out more about<em> Five Against a Bullet</em> below!<span id="more-311981"></span></p>
<p>Last we heard, Carnahan was likely to rewrite the script that originally came from <em>Predators</em> and <em>The Three Musketeers</em> scribe <strong>Alex Litvak</strong>. And now Suretone Pictures hopes that this could start a potential action franchise, though the movie doesn&#8217;t yet have a studio home for distribution yet.</p>
<p>But it sounds like the project shouldn&#8217;t have any problem getting off the ground as <a href="http://deadline.com/2015/08/vincent-donofrio-the-kid-james-franco-ethan-hawke-joe-carnahan-five-against-a-bullet-suretone-pictures-1201508292/">Deadline</a> says Schur and his Suretone banner has funded development and will also be financing production himself. That&#8217;s a pretty strong vote of confidence if Schur is willing to make this one of the first projects his new motion picture endeavor is working on. So what&#8217;s it about?</p>
<p>The story sounds right up Carnahan&#8217;s alley as it follows five elite bodyguards who are tasked with keeping a mayoral candidate safe during the elections in one of the most powerful cities in Mexico. Protection is of the utmost important and on high alert after the candidate&#8217;s father and previous mayor are murdered, with an army of drug cartel hitmen still out for blood, all under command of the most dangerous kingpin in the country.</p>
<p>Knowing the kind of wild action Carnahan has delivered before, this could be a fantastic action thriller. But now we have to wait to see who will end up starring in the flick now that Bruce Willis is no longer involved. Though at this time there&#8217;s no indication as to how soon Suretone wants to get cameras rolling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how this could be the start of a franchise unless a sequel would keep following the team of bodyguards assigned to protect this mayoral candidate, almost like a squad of bodyguard-Avengers, but we&#8217;ll likely have a better idea of how that would work after we see the movie.</p>
